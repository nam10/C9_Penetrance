<i>Freely available code that was used in our C9ORF72 Penetrance paper, detailing how to replicate the survival curve analyses.

To use, save the C9_data CSV file to your working directory and then run the code. The C9_Penetrance code will output the Kaplan-Meier survival curve data and plots and density plots used in the paper.

To apply this code to another disease, simply follow the format of the data table provided and supply pertinent patient information. The code can also be manipulated to calculate different subsets of survival curve data, simply by changing the subset parameters as desired.
